# Text to Morse

---

## Overview 

---

This is a simple python text-based program that converts text into morse and vice-versa. It also considers punctation as well as capitalizing the first letter of every sentence.

I made it for an assignment in Angela Yu's course on Python on Udemy. I did not take help from any solutions. I did everything myself except getting the dictionary data from GeeksforGeeks and googling to get a refresher on how to use values to get keys from a dictionary. 

## Features

---

- Convert text to morse
- Convert morse to text

## Credits

---

I took the dictionary data from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/morse-code-translator-python/).

For getting the keys from the values I took help from [these notes](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-dict-get-key-from-value/).
